Utilizing the Google Map API, I was able to find locations within a 2000 meter radius of downtown Indy. Within these I gathered, name, addresss, rating, hours and anything else of importance. I then created a csv that has my plan of action.
Unfortunately I wasn't able to finish this project due sudden circumstances.
